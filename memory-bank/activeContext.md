# Active Context: Next.js + Zustand Boilerplate

## Current Work Focus
- The application has been successfully deployed to Vercel
- The project is a demonstration of Zustand state management in Next.js
- The Memory Bank documentation is being established to track project context

## Recent Changes
- Deployed the application to Vercel
- Created Memory Bank documentation to track project context and progress

## Next Steps
Potential next steps for this project could include:
- Adding more complex state management examples
- Implementing persistence with Zustand middleware
- Adding tests for components and store
- Enhancing the UI with more interactive elements
- Adding more documentation or tutorials

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Deployment Strategy
- The application is deployed to Vercel as a new project
- The deployment is linked to the GitHub repository for continuous deployment
- No custom domains have been set up yet

### Documentation Strategy
- Memory Bank documentation has been created to track project context
- Documentation includes project brief, product context, system patterns, and technical context
- This will help maintain context for future development

### State Management Patterns
- The current implementation uses a simple Zustand store
- Each component subscribes only to the parts of the state it needs
- Actions are defined in the store for modifying state

### UI Considerations
- The UI is clean and minimal, focusing on demonstrating functionality
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling
- The application is responsive and works on different screen sizes
